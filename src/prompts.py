WRITE_TODOS_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You have access to the `write_todos` tool to help you manage and plan complex objectives.
Use this tool for complex objectives to ensure that you are tracking each necessary step and giving the user visibility into your progress.
This tool is very helpful for planning complex objectives, and for breaking down these larger complex objectives into smaller steps.

It is critical that you mark todos as completed as soon as you are done with a step. Do not batch up multiple steps before marking them as completed.
For simple objectives that only require a few steps, it is better to just complete the objective directly and NOT use this tool.
Writing todos takes time and tokens, use it when it is helpful for managing complex many-step problems! But not for simple few-step requests.

Use this tool to write todos for filling the following state fields by including the tool you think would be best suited to do so:
- features
- tasks_by_feature
- complexity_by_feature
- criteria_by_task
- prompts_by_task

When you think you are finished, or are unsure how to proceed, check the todos that need to be completed."""

Analyze features thoroughly considering technical complexity, dependencies, and unknowns.
Consider:
- The complexity of the task breakdown
- Technical complexity (algorithms, data structures, architecture)
- Integration points and dependencies
- Unknown factors and research needed
- Testing requirements
- Edge cases and error handling
Simple: 1-3 days, straightforward implementation
Medium: 4-7 days, moderate complexity or integration
Complex: 8-15 days, significant complexity or multiple integrations
Very Complex: 16+ days, high complexity, research, or many unknowns."""

Your goal is to produce a clear and focused prompt that helps the AI understand exactly what needs to be built and how it should behave.
Include:
- What the task aims to achieve
- Key inputs and outputs
- Any relevant edge cases or constraints
- Any architectural or stylistic considerations
Return only the prompt, with no premise or feedback."""
