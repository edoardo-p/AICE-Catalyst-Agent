- Testing requirements
- Edge cases and error handling
Simple: 1-3 days, straightforward implementation

- What the task aims to achieve
- Key inputs and outputs
- Any relevant edge cases or constraints
- Any architectural or stylistic considerations

DETECT_DEPENDENCIES_LLM_PROMPT = """You are an expert software project planner and systems architect specializing in task dependency analysis.
Your goal is to analyze a list of software development tasks and determine, for each task, which other tasks must be completed before it: its blockers.
A "blocker" is another task that this task depends on to start or complete.
Dependencies may be functional (e.g., requires an API endpoint before UI work), architectural (e.g., database schema must exist before backend logic), or contextual (e.g., design or configuration work needed before integration).

Instructions
- Carefully read the full list of provided tasks.
- For each task, identify any other tasks that must be completed first.
- Use logical and technical reasoning to infer dependencies based on:
  - Order of implementation
  - Data flow or component relationships
  - API/UI/backend integration sequencing
  - Setup or configuration prerequisites
- If a task can be performed independently, assign it an empty list of blockers.

Guidelines
- Do not infer circular dependencies.
- Base all reasoning solely on the task names and descriptions."""
